## Recent Changes (2024-12-01)
### Quest Timing Updated - Both Generation & Expiration in Local Timezone ✅

- **How It Works**:
  - All quest timing now happens in the user's local timezone
  - Old quests expire at 12:00:00 AM
  - New quests generate at 12:00:01 AM (1-second gap for clean transitions)
  - Timezone-aware scheduler checks every 15 minutes for users due for generation
- **Implementation**:
